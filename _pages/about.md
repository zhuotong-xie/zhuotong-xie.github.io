Welcome to my website!

I am a Quantitative Analytics Senior at Freddie Mac. I am working on credit risk models for mortgage markets.

Before that, I got my Ph.D. degree in Economics at Stony Brook University in 2024. My research interests include topics in labor economics, family economics, and applied microeconomics. My research seeks to better understand marriage markets and their effects on socioeconomic phenomena.
